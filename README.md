# questt_project

A new Flutter project.

## Approach:

- We create a stateful widget called My App and call it. Inside of which we called a Material App and home of which will be the ```dailySummary``` widget.
- Then inside the dailySummary widget we call the ```getLocation()``` function and store the values of latitude, longitude for making the API calls.
